<h2>Register profile</h2>
<p>Oups! You seem to have logged in from
<%= @provider_user["provider"] %> but you donÂ´t have a profile.<br>
Lets hook you up right away.
  <small>Or <a href="/profile/logout">logout</a> and come back another day.</small>
</p>


<p>We have pre-filled out what we could from your <%= @provider_user["provider"] %> login.</p>
<%= render "form.html", changeset: @changeset,
                        action: profile_path(@conn, :create) %>
<%= link "Back", to: profile_path(@conn, :index) %>
